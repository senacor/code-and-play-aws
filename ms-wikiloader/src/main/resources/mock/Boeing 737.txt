The '''Boeing 737''' is a [[Flight length#Categories|short- to medium-range]] [[twinjet]] [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body]] [[airliner]]. Originally developed as a shorter, lower-cost twin-engined airliner derived from Boeing's [[Boeing 707|707]] and [[Boeing 727|727]], the 737 has developed into a family of ten passenger models with a capacity of 85 to 215 passengers. The 737 is Boeing's only narrow-body airliner in production, with the -700, -800, and -900ER variants currently being built. A re-engined and redesigned version, the [[Boeing 737 MAX|737 MAX]], is set to debut in 2017.

Originally envisioned in 1964, the initial 737-100 made its first flight in April 1967 and entered airline service in February 1968 at [[Lufthansa]].<ref name=fg6000>Kingsley-Jones, Max.

In the 1980s Boeing launched the -300, -400, and -500 models, subsequently referred to as the [[Boeing 737 Classic]] series. The 737 Classics added capacity and incorporated [[CFM International CFM56#CFM56-3B-1|CFM56]] [[turbofan]] engines along with wing improvements.

In the 1990s Boeing introduced the [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737 Next Generation]] with multiple changes including a redesigned, increased span laminar flow wing, upgraded "glass" cockpit, and new interior. The 737 Next Generation comprises the four -600, -700, -800, and -900 models, ranging from {{convert|102|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|138|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} in length. [[Boeing Business Jet]] versions of the 737 Next Generation are also produced.

The 737 series is the best-selling jet commercial airliner.<ref name=fg6000 /> The 737 has been continuously manufactured by [[Boeing]] since 1967 with 8,845 aircraft delivered and 4,392 orders yet to be fulfilled {{as of|2015|12|lc=on}}.<ref name=737_O_D_summ/> 737 assembly is centered at the [[Boeing Renton Factory]] in [[Renton, Washington]].

===Background===
Boeing had been studying short-haul jet aircraft designs and wanted to produce another aircraft to supplement the [[Boeing 727|727]] on short and thin routes.<ref name="nyt transport news">"[http://www.nytimes.com/1964/07/17/transport-news-boeing-plans-jet.html?gwh=DC51C313D9636DB7CDF928D96B139F02&gwt=pay Transport News: Boeing Plans Jet.]" ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 17, 1964.

[[File:NASA TEST 737-100 prototype.jpg|thumb|left|The prototype 737, a -100 operated by [[NASA]] for testing.]]
On April 5, 1965, Boeing announced an order by [[United Airlines]] for 40 737s. United wanted a slightly larger airplane than the original 737.  So Boeing stretched the fuselage {{convert|91|cm|in|sp=us}} ahead of, and {{convert|102|cm|in|abbr=on}} behind the wing.{{sfn|Sharpe|Shaw|2001|p=17|ps=}} The longer version was designated 737-200, with the original short-body aircraft becoming the 737-100.{{sfn|Redding|Yenne|1997|p=182|ps=}}

Detailed design work continued on both variants at the same time. Boeing was far behind its competitors when the 737 was launched, as rival aircraft [[BAC One-Eleven|BAC-111]], [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|Douglas DC-9]], and [[Fokker F28]] were already into flight certification.<ref name="german order"/> To expedite development, Boeing used 60% of the structure and systems of the existing 727, the most notable being the fuselage cross-section. This fuselage permitted six-abreast seating compared to the rival BAC-111 and DC-9's five-abreast layout.{{sfn|Sharpe|Shaw|2001|p=13|ps=}} Design engineers decided to mount the [[nacelle]]s directly to the underside of the wings to reduce the landing gear length and kept the engines low to the ground for easy ramp inspection and servicing.<ref name="JoeSutter">Sutter 2006, pp. 76–78.</ref> Many thickness variations for the engine attachment strut were tested in the wind tunnel and the most desirable shape for high speed was found to be one which was relatively thick, filling the narrow channels formed between the wing and the top of the nacelle, particularly on the outboard side. Originally, the span arrangement of the airfoil sections of the 737 wing was planned to be very similar to that of the 707 and 727, although somewhat thicker. However, a substantial improvement in drag at high Mach numbers was achieved by altering these sections near the nacelle.<ref>Olason, M.L. and Norton, D.A.

The initial assembly of the 737 was adjacent to [[Boeing Field]] (now officially named King County International Airport) because the factory in [[Renton Municipal Airport|Renton]] was filled to capacity with the building of the 707 and 727. After 271 aircraft were built, production moved to Renton in late 1970.<ref name="Wallace">Wallace, J.

The fuselage is joined with the wings and landing gear, then moves down the assembly line for the engines, avionics, and interiors.

===Initial derivatives===
[[File:United Airlines Boeing 737-222 Marmet.jpg|thumb|left|An early-production, retrofitted [[United Airlines]] 737-200 with deployed thrust reversers]]

The original engine nacelles incorporated thrust reversers taken from the 727 outboard nacelles. However, they proved to be relatively ineffective and apparently tended to lift the aircraft up off the runway when deployed. This reduced the downforce on the main wheels thereby reducing the effectiveness of the wheel brakes. In 1968, an improvement to the [[thrust reversal]] system was introduced.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sharpe, Shaw|first1=Mike, Robbie|title=Boeing 737-100 and 200|date=2001|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSqPyNcxsO0C&pg=PT21&lpg=PT21&dq=boeing+1968+thrust+reverser&source=bl&ots=rbHcCSNcYb&sig=UsD_RC6BgAxTxLVJVL4Ndo9v5ZM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEAQ6AEwB2oVChMI-sGog7SexwIVDDM-Ch0zlQpL#v=onepage&q=boeing%201968%20thrust%20reverser&f=false|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}</ref> A 48-inch tailpipe extension was added and new, target-style, thrust reversers were incorporated. The thrust reverser doors were set 35 degrees away from the vertical to allow the exhaust to be deflected inboard and over the wings and outboard and under the wings.<ref>[http://www.b737.org.uk/powerplant.htm "Powerplant - Reverse Thrust."] ''b737.org.uk.'' Retrieved: November 1, 2011.</ref> The improvement became standard on all aircraft after March 1969, and a retrofit was provided for active aircraft. Boeing fixed the drag issue by introducing new longer nacelle/wing fairings, and improved the airflow over the flaps and slats. The production line also introduced an improvement to the flap system, allowing increased use during takeoff and landing. All these changes gave the aircraft a boost to payload and range, and improved short-field performance.{{sfn|Sharpe|Shaw|2001|p=20|ps=}} In May 1971, after aircraft #135, all improvements, including more powerful engines and a greater fuel capacity, were incorporated into the 737-200, giving it a 15% increase in payload and range over the original -200s.{{sfn|Redding|Yenne|1997|p=183|ps=}} This became known as the 737-200 Advanced, which became the production standard in June 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/commercial/airports/acaps/737.pdf |title= 737 Airplane Characteristics for Airport Planning |date= May 2011 |publisher= Boeing |accessdate= 7 February 2015}}</ref>

In 1970, Boeing received only 37 orders. Facing financial difficulties, Boeing considered closing the 737 production-line and selling the design to Japanese aviation companies.<ref name="Wallace"/> After the cancellation of the [[Boeing 2707|Boeing Supersonic Transport]], and scaling back of 747 production, enough funds were freed up to continue the project.{{sfn|Sharpe|Shaw|2001|p=21|ps=}}  In a bid to increase sales by offering a variety of options, Boeing offered a 737C (Convertible) model in both -100 and -200 lengths.

===Improved variants===
{{Main|Boeing 737 Classic}}

Development began in 1979 for the 737's first major revision. Boeing wanted to increase capacity and range, incorporating improvements to upgrade the aircraft to modern specifications, while also retaining commonality with previous 737 variants. In 1980, preliminary aircraft specifications of the variant, dubbed 737-300, were released at the [[Farnborough Airshow]].{{sfn|Endres|2001|p=126|ps=}}

[[File:Lufthansa-1.jpg|thumb|left|The 737-300 was the first Classic variant]]
Boeing engineer Mark Gregoire led a design team, which cooperated with [[CFM International]] to select, modify and deploy a new engine and nacelle that would make the 737-300 into a viable aircraft.  They chose the [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56-3B-1]] [[Bypass ratio|high-bypass]] [[turbofan]] engine to power the aircraft, which yielded significant gains in fuel economy and a reduction in noise, but also posed an engineering challenge, given the low ground clearance of the 737 and the larger diameter of the engine over the original Pratt & Whitney engines. Gregoire's team and CFM solved the problem by reducing the size of the fan (which made the engine slightly less efficient than it had been forecast to be), placing the engine ahead of the wing, and by moving engine accessories to the sides of the engine pod, giving the engine a distinctive non-circular "[[hamster|hamster pouch]]"<ref name="hamster">Brady, Chris.

The passenger capacity of the aircraft was increased to 149 by extending the fuselage around the wing by {{convert|2.87|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The wing incorporated a number of changes for improved aerodynamics. The wingtip was extended {{convert|9|in|cm|abbr=on}}, and the wingspan by {{convert|1|ft|9|in|cm|abbr=on}}. The leading-edge slats and trailing-edge flaps were adjusted.{{sfn|Endres|2001|p=128|ps=}} The tailfin was redesigned, the flight deck was improved with the optional EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrumentation System), and the passenger cabin incorporated improvements similar to those developed on the [[Boeing 757]].{{sfn|Shaw|1999|p=10|ps=}} The prototype -300, the 1,001st 737 built, first flew on 24 February 1984 with pilot Jim McRoberts.{{sfn|Shaw|1999|p=10|ps=}} It and two production aircraft flew a nine-month-long certification program.{{sfn|Shaw|1999|pp=12–13|ps=}}

The -500 series was offered, due to customer demand, as a modern and direct replacement of the 737-200. It incorporated the improvements of the 737 Classic series, allowing longer routes with fewer passengers to be more economical than with the 737-300. The fuselage length of the -500 is {{convert|1|ft|7|in|cm|abbr=on}} longer than the 737-200, accommodating up to 140<ref>FAA Type Certificate Data Sheet  http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/0/9c59427a20b3253686257d03004d8faa/$FILE/A16WE_Rev_53.pdf</ref> passengers.

The 737-500 was launched in 1987 by [[Southwest Airlines]], with an order for 20 aircraft,{{sfn|Shaw|1999|p=40|ps=}} and flew for the first time on June 30, 1989.{{sfn|Shaw|1999|p=14|ps=}} A single prototype flew 375 hours for the certification process,{{sfn|Shaw|1999|p=14|ps=}} and on February 28, 1990, [[Southwest Airlines]] received the first delivery.{{sfn|Endres|2001|p=129|ps=}}

After the introduction of the -600/700/800/900 series, the -300/400/500 series was called the 737 Classic series.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.boeing.com/boeing/commercial/737family/facts.page |title= Boeing: Boeing 737 Facts |date= September 6, 2013 |accessdate= February 7, 2015 |publisher= Boeing}}</ref>

Prompted by the modern [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]], Boeing initiated development of an updated series of aircraft in 1991.{{sfn|Endres|2001|p=132|ps=}} After working with potential customers, the 737 Next Generation (NG) program was announced on November&nbsp;17, 1993.{{sfn|Shaw|1999|p=8|ps=}} The 737NG encompasses the -600, -700, -800, and -900, and is to date the most significant upgrade of the airframe. The performance of the 737NG is, in essence, that of a new aircraft, but important commonality is retained from previous 737 models.<ref name="About the 737 Family" />

The wing was redesigned with a new [[airfoil]] section, greater [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]], increased wing span by {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}} and area by 25%, which increased total fuel capacity by 30%. New, quieter, more fuel-efficient [[CFM International CFM56#CFM56-7 series|CFM56-7B]] engines were used.{{sfn|Endres|2001|p=133|ps=}} The wing, engine, and fuel capacity improvements combined increase the 737's range by 900&nbsp;nautical miles to over {{convert|3000|nmi|km}},<ref name=737family>{{cite web|title=About the 737 Family|url=http://www.boeing.com/boeing/commercial/737family/background.page|website=www.boeing.com|publisher=Boeing|accessdate={{date|2014-11-18}}}}</ref> now permitting transcontinental service.{{sfn|Shaw|1999|p=8|ps=}} With the increased fuel capacity, higher [[maximum takeoff weight]] (MTOW) specifications are offered.

The first NG to roll out was a -700, on December 8, 1996. This aircraft, the 2,843rd 737 built, first flew on February 9, 1997. The prototype -800 rolled out on June 30, 1997, and first flew on July 31, 1997. The smallest of the new variants, the -600s, is the same size as the -500. It was the last in this series to launch, in December 1997. First flying January 22, 1998, it was given certification on August 18, 1998.{{sfn|Shaw|1999|p=8|ps=}}{{sfn|Shaw|1999|pp=14–15|ps=}} A flight test program was operated by 10 aircraft; 3 -600s, 4 -700s, and 3 -800s.{{sfn|Shaw|1999|p=8|ps=}}

In 2004, Boeing offered a Short Field Performance package in response to the needs of [[Gol Transportes Aéreos]], which frequently operates from restricted airports. The enhancements improve takeoff and landing performance. The optional package is available for the 737NG models and standard equipment for the 737-900ER. The CFM56-7B Evolution nacelle began testing in August 2009 to be used on the new 737 PIP (Performance Improvement Package) due to enter service mid-2011. This new improvement is said to shave at least 1% off overall drag and have some weight benefits. Overall, it is claimed to have a 2% improvement on fuel burn on longer stages.<ref name=margins>Kingsley-Jones, Max.

==Design==
[[File:737under.jpg|thumb|Boeing 737-700 showing the retracted [[landing gear]] and engine [[nacelle]]s with flattened underside and triangular shape]]

The 737's main landing gear under the wings at mid-cabin rotates into wells in the aircraft's belly. The legs are covered by partial doors, and "brush-like" seals aerodynamically smooth (or "fair") the wheels in the wells. The sides of the tires are exposed to the air in flight. "Hub caps" complete the aerodynamic profile of the wheels. It is forbidden to operate without the caps, because they are linked to the ground speed sensor that interfaces with the anti-skid brake system.  The dark circles of the tires are clearly visible when a 737 takes off, or is at low altitude.<ref>Dekkers, Daniel, et al. (Project 2A2H).

737s are not equipped with [[fuel dump systems]]. The original aircraft were too small to require them, and adding a fuel dump system to the later, larger variants would have incurred a large weight penalty. Boeing instead demonstrated an "equivalent level of safety". Depending upon the nature of the emergency, 737s either circle to burn off fuel or land overweight. If the latter is the case, the aircraft is inspected by maintenance personnel for damage and then returned to service if none is found.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boeing Commercial Aircraft - In-Flight Fuel Jettison Capability|url=http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/commercial/airports/faqs/fueldump.pdf|publisher=Boeing|accessdate={{date|2014-11-23}}|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>Cheung, Humphrey.

===Engines===
[[File:CFM 56 Lauda 737.jpg|thumb|left|737-800 engine with non-circular "hamster pouch"<ref name="hamster"/> inlet]]

Engines on the 737 Classic series (300, 400, 500) and Next-Generation series (600, 700, 800, 900) do not have circular inlets like most aircraft. The 737 Classic series featured [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56]] [[turbofan]] engines, which yielded significant gains in fuel economy and a reduction in noise over the [[JT8D]] engines used on the -100 and -200, but also posed an engineering challenge given the low ground clearance of the 737. Boeing and engine supplier [[CFM International|CFMI]] solved the problem by placing the engine ahead of (rather than below) the wing, and by moving engine accessories to the sides (rather than the bottom) of the engine pod, giving the 737 a distinctive non-circular air intake.{{sfn|Endres|2001|p=128|ps=}}

The wing also incorporated a number of changes for improved aerodynamics. The engines' accessory [[gearbox]] was moved from the 6 o'clock position under the engine to the 4 o'clock position (from a front/forward looking aft perspective). This side-mounted gearbox gives the engine a somewhat triangular rounded shape. Because the engine is close to the ground, 737-300s and later models are more prone to engine [[foreign object damage]] (FOD). The improved [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56-7]] turbofan engine on the 737 Next Generation is 7% more fuel-efficient than the previous CFM56-3 in the 737 classics.  The newest 737 variants, the 737 MAX family, are to feature [[CFM International LEAP-X|CFM International LEAP-1B]] engines with a 1.73 m fan diameter.  These engines are expected to be 10-12% more efficient than the CFM56-7B engines on the 737 Next Generation family.<ref>{{cite news |last= Ostrower |first= Jon |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/08/30/361428/boeing-designates-737-max-family.html |archiveurl= http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110925210731/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/08/30/361428/boeing-designates-737-max-family.html |archivedate= 2011-09-25 |title= Boeing designates 737 MAX family |date= August 30, 2011 |work=Air Transport Intelligence |accessdate =September 5, 2011}}</ref>

The [[Aircraft flight control systems|primary flight controls]] are intrinsically safe. In the event of total hydraulic system failure or double engine failure, they will automatically and seamlessly revert to control via [[servo tab]]. In this mode, the servo tabs aerodynamically control the elevators and ailerons; these servo tabs are in turn controlled by cables running to the control yoke. The pilot's muscle forces alone control the tabs. For the 737 Next Generation, a six-screen LCD [[glass cockpit]] with modern avionics was implemented while retaining crew commonality with previous generation 737.<ref name="sixscreen">{{cite web | url=http://theflyingengineer.com/flightdeck/boeings-max-southwests-737/ | title=Boeing’s MAX, Southwest’s 737 | publisher=theflyingengineer | accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref>

Blended [[wingtip device|winglets]] are in production on 737 NG aircraft and are available for retrofit on 737 Classic models. These winglets stand approximately {{convert|8|ft|m}} tall and are installed at the wing tips. They help to reduce fuel burn (by reducing [[vortex]] drag), engine wear, and takeoff noise. Overall fuel efficiency improvement is up to five percent through the reduction of lift-induced drag.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/qtr_03_09/pdfs/AERO_Q309_article03.pdf |title=Blended winglets improve performance |work=Aero Magazine |year=2009 |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |last=Freitag |first=William |author2=Schulze, Terry|pages=9, 12}}</ref><ref name="blended_winglets">{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_17/winglet_story.html|title=Blended Winglets|last1=Faye|first1=Robert|year=2002 |last2=Laprete |first2=Robert |last3=Winter |first3=Michael |work=Aero Magazine |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>

====Carbon brakes====
{{As of|2008|07}} the 737 features carbon [[brake]]s manufactured by [[Messier-Bugatti]]. These new brakes, now certified by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], weigh {{convert|550|-|700|lb|kg|abbr=on}} less than the steel brakes normally fitted to the Next-Gen 737s (weight savings depend on whether standard or high-capacity brakes are fitted).<ref name=cfb>Volkmann, Kelsey.

====Short-field design package====
A short-field design package is available for the 737-600, -700, and -800, allowing operators to fly increased payload to and from airports with runways under {{convert|5000|ft|m}}. The package consists of sealed [[leading edge slats]] (improved lift), a two-position tail skid (enabling greater protection against tail strikes that may be caused by the lower landing speeds), and increased flight spoiler deflection on the ground. These improvements are standard on the 737-900ER.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boeing Delivers First 737 with Enhanced Short Runway Package to GOL|url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2006-07-31-Boeing-Delivers-First-737-with-Enhanced-Short-Runway-Package-to-GOL|publisher=Boeing|accessdate={{date|2014-11-21}}|date=July 31, 2006}}</ref>

===Interior===
The 737 interior arrangement has changed in successive generations. The original 737 interior was restyled for the 737 Classic models using 757 designs, while 777 architecture was used for the debut of the Next Generation 737. Designed using Boeing's new cabin concepts, the latest Sky Interior features sculpted sidewalls and redesigned window housings, along with increased headroom and LED [[mood lighting]].<ref name=margins/><ref name=skyinterior>[http://www.businessinsider.com/check-out-boeings-swanky-new-high-tech-interior-2011-1 "Check Out Boeing's Swanky New High-Tech Interior."] ''businessinsider.com.''

==Variants==
The 737 models can be divided into three generations, including nine major variants. The "Original" models consist of the 737-100, 737-200/-200 Advanced. The "Classic" models consist of the 737-300, 737-400, and 737-500. The "Next Generation" variants consist of the 737-600, 737-700/-700ER, 737-800, and 737-900/-900ER. Of these nine variants, many feature additional versions such as the T-43, which was a modified Boeing 737-200 used by the United States Air Force (USAF).

The fourth generation derivative - the 737 MAX - is currently under development and will encompass the 737-MAX-7, 737-MAX-8, and 737-MAX-9 which will replace the -700, -800 and -900/900ER versions of the NG family, respectively.

===737 Original series===
[[File:Lufthansa Boeing 737-100 in Zurich 1981.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lufthansa]] 737-100]]

====737-100====
The initial model was the 737-100. It was launched in February 1965. The -100 was rolled out on January 17, 1967, had its first flight on April 9, 1967 and entered service with [[Lufthansa]] in February 1968. The aircraft is the smallest variant of the 737. A total of 30 737-100s were ordered and delivered; the final commercial delivery took place on October 31, 1969 to [[Malaysia–Singapore Airlines]]. No 737-100s remain in commercial service. The original Boeing prototype, last operated by [[NASA]] and retired more than 30 years after its maiden flight, is on exhibit in the [[Museum of Flight]] in Seattle.{{sfn|Shaw|1999|p=8|ps=}}

====737-200====
[[File:Canadian North B737-200.jpg|thumb|[[Canadian North]] Boeing 737-200C]]

The 737-200 is a 737-100 with an extended fuselage, launched by an order from [[United Airlines]] in 1965. The -200 was rolled out on June 29, 1967, and entered service at United in April 1968. The 737-200 Advanced is an improved version of the -200, introduced into service by [[All Nippon Airways]] on May 20, 1971.{{sfn|Bowers|1989|p=496|ps=}} The -200 Advanced has improved aerodynamics, automatic wheel brakes, more powerful engines, more fuel capacity, and longer range than the -100.{{sfn|Sharpe|Shaw|2001|p=41|ps=}} Boeing also provided the 737-200C (Convertible), which allowed for conversion between passenger and cargo use and the 737-200QC (Quick Change), which facilitated a rapid conversion between roles. The 1,095th and last delivery of a -200 series aircraft was in August 1988 to [[Xiamen Airlines]].<ref name=737_O_D_summ>{{cite web|title=Boeing Commercial Airplanes – Orders and Deliveries – 737 Model Summary |url=http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/displaystandardreport.cfm?cboCurrentModel=737&optReportType=AllModels&cboAllModel=737&ViewReportF=View+Report |website=boeing.com| publisher=Boeing |date=November 30, 2015 |accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref><ref name="About the 737 Family">[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/737family/background.html "About the 737 Family."] ''The Boeing Company''.

With a [[gravelkit]] modification the 737-200 can use unimproved or unpaved landing strips, such as gravel runways, that other similarly-sized jet aircraft cannot. Gravel-kitted 737-200 Combis are currently used by [[Canadian North]], [[First Air]], [[Air Inuit]] and [[Air North]] in northern Canada. For many years, [[Alaska Airlines]] made use of gravel-kitted 737-200s to serve Alaska's many unimproved runways across the state.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Airplane That Never Sleeps|url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2002-07-15-The-Airplane-That-Never-Sleeps|publisher=Boeing|accessdate={{date|2014-11-19}}|date=July 15, 2002}}</ref>

Nineteen 737-200s were used to train aircraft navigators for the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], designated [[Boeing T-43|T-43]]. Some were modified into CT-43s, which are used to transport passengers, and one was modified as the NT-43A Radar Test Bed. The first was delivered on July 31, 1973 and the last on July 19, 1974. The [[Indonesian Air Force]] ordered three modified 737-200s, designated ''Boeing 737-2x9 Surveiller''. They were used as Maritime reconnaissance (MPA)/transport aircraft, fitted with SLAMMAR (Side-looking Multi-mission Airborne Radar). The aircraft were delivered between May 1982 and October 1983.{{sfn|Bowers|1989|pp=498–499|ps=}}

After 40 years the final 737-200 aircraft in the U.S. flying scheduled passenger service were phased out in March 2008, with the last flights of [[Aloha Airlines]].<ref name="swretire">{{cite web |url=http://swamedia.com/releases/Southwest-Airlines-Retires-Last-of-Founding-Aircraft-Employees-Help-Celebrate-the-Boeing-737-200-s-Final-Flight?mode=print |title=Southwest Airlines Retires Last of Founding Aircraft; Employees Help Celebrate the Boeing 737-200's Final Flight |publisher=swamedia.com |accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> The variant still sees regular service through North American charter operators such as [[Sierra Pacific Airlines|Sierra Pacific]].<ref name=census2014>{{cite journal|title=World Airliner Census 2014|journal=Flightglobal Insight|date=2014|page=12}}</ref>

===737 Classic series===
{{Main|Boeing 737 Classic}}

The ''Boeing 737 Classic'' is the name given to the -300/-400/-500 series of the Boeing 737 after the introduction of the -600/700/800/900 series. The Classic series was originally introduced as the 'new generation' of the 737.{{sfn|Shaw|1999|p=7|ps=}} Produced from 1984 to 2000, 1,988 aircraft were delivered.{{sfn|Endres|2001|p=129|ps=}}

===737 Next Generation===
{{Main|Boeing 737 Next Generation}}

By the early 1990s, it became clear that the new [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] was a serious threat to Boeing's market share, as Airbus won previously loyal 737 customers such as Lufthansa and United Airlines. In November 1993, Boeing's board of directors authorized the Next Generation program to replace the 737 Classic series. The -600, -700, and -800 series were planned.<ref>[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/737family/pf/pf_ng_milestones.html "Next Generation 737 Program Milestones."] ''The Boeing Company.'' Retrieved: January 22, 2008.</ref> After engineering trade studies and discussions with major 737 customers, Boeing proceeded to launch the 737 Next Generation series.

===737 MAX===
{{main|Boeing 737 MAX}}

In 2011, Boeing announced the [[Boeing 737 MAX|737 MAX]] program. Boeing will be offering three variants-the 737-7, 737-8 and the 737-9. These aircraft will replace the 737-700, 737-800 and 737-900ER, respectively. The main changes are the use of [[CFM International LEAP-X|CFM International LEAP-1B engines]], the addition of fly-by-wire control to the spoilers, and the lengthening of the nose landing gear. Deliveries are scheduled to begin in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=1908 |title= Boeing Introduces 737 MAX With Launch of New Aircraft Family |date= August 30, 2011 |accessdate= November 9, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/12/us-dubai-airshow-boeing-idUSTRE7AB0JF20111112 |title = AIRSHOW-Boeing 737 draft orders reach 700 |date= November 12, 2011 |accessdate= November 18, 2011 |work=Reuters |first=Tim |last=Hepher}}</ref> Southwest Airlines announced on December 13, 2011 that it would order the 737 MAX and became the launch customer.<ref name="cnn">{{cite news|title=Boeing sets record with $22 billion order |url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/17/news/companies/boeing_order/index.htm |publisher=CNN Money |date= November 17, 2011 |accessdate= February 15, 2012 |first=Logan |last=Burruss}}</ref> [[Ryanair]], [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]], and others have also placed firm orders for 737 MAX aircraft.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2014/12/02/ryanair-finalizes-737-max-200-boeing-order/19784581/|title=Ryanair finalizes Boeing 737 MAX 200 order|publisher=''Associated Press''|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}</ref>

{{Main|Boeing Business Jet}}

The Boeing Business Jet is a customized version of the 737. Plans for a business jet version of the 737 are not new. In the late 1980s, Boeing marketed the 77-33 jet, a business jet version of the 737-300.<ref>Endres 2001.</ref> The name was short-lived. After the introduction of the next generation series, Boeing introduced the Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) series. The BBJ1 was similar in dimensions to the 737-700 but had additional features, including stronger wings and landing gear from the 737-800, and had increased range (through the use of extra fuel tanks) over the other 737 models. The first BBJ rolled out on August 11, 1998 and flew for the first time on September 4.<ref name="BBJ">[http://cdn-www.airliners.net/info/stats.main?id=108 "The Boeing 737-700/800 BBJ/BBJ2."] ''airliners.net''. Retrieved: February 3, 2008.</ref>

On October 11, 1999 Boeing launched the BBJ2. Based on the 737-800, it is {{convert|5.84|m|ftin|sp=us}} longer than the BBJ, with 25% more cabin space and twice the baggage space, but has slightly reduced range. It is also fitted with auxiliary belly fuel tanks and winglets. The first BBJ2 was delivered on 28 February 2001.<ref name="BBJ"/>

Boeing's BBJ3 is based on the 737-900ER. The BBJ3 has {{convert|1120|sqft|m2}} of floor space, 35% more interior space, and 89% more luggage space than the BBJ2. It has an auxiliary fuel system, giving it a range of up to {{convert|4725|nmi|km}}, and a [[Head-up display]]. Boeing completed the first example in August 2008. This aircraft's cabin is pressurized to a simulated {{convert|6500|ft|m|sing=on}} altitude.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boeing Business Jets Launches New Family Member|url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2006-10-16-Boeing-Business-Jets-Launches-New-Family-Member|publisher=Boeing|accessdate={{date|2014-11-22}}|date=October 16, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Boeing Completes First BBJ 3|url=https://www.wingsmagazine.com/news/boeing-completes-first-bbj-3-1833|website=www.wingsmagazine.com|publisher=Wings|accessdate={{date|2014-11-22}}|date=August 14, 2008}}</ref>

===Freighter===

Boeing is studying plans to offer passenger to freighter conversion for the 737-800. Boeing has signed a  agreement with Chinese YTO Airlines to provide the airline with 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighters (BCFs) pending a planned program launch.<ref>Boeing to launch 737 freighter conversion program| http://www.aviationanalysis.net/2015/10/boeing-to-launch-737-freighter-conversion.html</ref>

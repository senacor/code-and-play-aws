The '''Airbus A320 family''' consists of [[Flight length#Categories|short- to medium-range]], [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body]], commercial passenger [[Twinjet|twin-engine]] [[jet airliner]]s manufactured by [[Airbus]]. The family includes the '''[[Airbus A318|A318]]''', '''A319''', '''A320''' and '''A321''', as well as the [[Airbus Executive and Private Aviation|ACJ]] [[business jet]].

The first member of the A320 family—the A320—was launched in March 1984, [[Maiden flight|first flew]] on 22 February 1987, and was first delivered in March 1988. The family was soon extended to include the A321 (first delivered 1994), the A319 (1996), and the A318 (2003). The A320 family pioneered the use of digital [[fly-by-wire]] [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]]s, as well as [[side-stick]] controls, in commercial aircraft. There has been a continuous improvement process since introduction.

As of 29 February 2016, a total of 6,932 Airbus A320-family aircraft [[List of Airbus A320 operators|have been delivered]], of which 6,631 are in service. In addition, another 5,531 airliners are [[List of Airbus A320 orders|on firm order]].

== Development ==

=== Origins ===
When Airbus designed the [[Airbus A300]] during the late 1960s and early 1970s, it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against [[Boeing]] and [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]], two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|page = 63}}</ref> Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, engineers within Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.<ref name="gunston2009">{{harvnb|Gunston|2009}}</ref> A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.<ref name="N&W p.18">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=18}}</ref> It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range [[Airbus A310]]. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the [[Boeing 737|737]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]].
[[File:Airbus A320-100 Air Inter Gilliand.jpg|thumb|[[Air Inter]] A320-100 in 1991, one of the few A320-100s]]

Plans from a number of European aircraft manufacturers called for a successor to the relatively successful [[BAC One-Eleven]], and to replace the [[Boeing 737-200|737–200]] and DC-9.<ref name="FG.com A320"/> Germany's MBB (''[[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm]]''), [[British Aircraft Corporation]], Sweden's [[Saab AB|Saab]] and Spain's [[EADS CASA|CASA]] worked on the ''EUROPLANE'', a 180- to 200-seat aircraft.<ref name="FG.com A320">{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1997/1997%20-%202904.html |title=A320 family |accessdate=17 February 2011 |year=1997 |work=Flight International }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=38}}</ref> It was abandoned after intruding on A310 specifications.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=41}}</ref> [[VFW-Fokker]], [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] and [[Hawker Siddeley]] worked on a number of 150-seat designs.<ref name="FG.com A320"/>

Alongside BAe (which at the time was not part of Airbus) were MBB, Fokker-VFW and [[Aérospatiale]]. The design within the JET study that was carried forward was the JET2 (163 passengers), which then became the Airbus S.A1/2/3 series (Single Aisle), before settling on the A320 name for its launch in 1984. Previously, Hawker Siddeley had produced a design called the HS.134 "Airbus" in 1965, an evolution of the [[Hawker Siddeley Trident|HS.121]] (formerly DH.121) ''Trident'',<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/coming%20of%20age/Hawker-Siddeley%20Trident.htm| title = Hawker Siddeley Trident|accessdate =7 January 2010| publisher=Century of Flight}}</ref> which shared much of the general arrangement of the later JET3 study design. The name "Airbus" at the time referred to a [[British European Airways|BEA]] requirement, rather than to the later international programme.

=== Design effort ===
<!-- Development cost $1.7&nbsp;billion<ref name=autogenerated1/>-->

A new programme was initiated subsequently, called ''Joint European Transport'' (JET). This was set up in June 1977,<ref>Payne, R. Stuck on the Drawing Board. Tempus, 2004.</ref> and was based at the then [[British Aerospace]] (formerly [[Vickers]]) site in [[Weybridge]], [[Surrey]], UK. Although the members were all of Airbus' partners, they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from Airbus.<ref name="Aris p.119">{{harvnb|Aris|2002|p=119}}</ref> This project was considered the forerunner of Airbus A320, encompassing the 130- to 188-seat market, powered by two [[CFM56]]s.<ref name="FG.com A320"/> It would have a cruise speed of Mach 0.84 (faster than Boeing 737).<ref name="FG.com A320"/> The programme was later transferred to Airbus, leading up to the creation of the ''Single-Aisle'' (SA) studies in 1980, led by former leader of JET programme, Derek Brown.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=43}}</ref> The group looked at three different variants, covering the 125- to 180-seat market, called ''SA1'', ''SA2'' and ''SA3''.<ref name="FG.com A320"/> Although unaware at the time, the consortium was producing the blueprints for the A319, A320 and A321, respectively.<ref name="N&W p.44">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=44}}</ref> The single-aisle programme created divisions within Airbus about whether to design a shorter-range twinjet than a longer-range quadjet wanted by the West Germans, particularly [[Lufthansa]].<ref name="FG.com A320"/><ref>{{harvnb|Aris|2002|p=120}}</ref> However, works proceeded, and the German carrier would eventually order the twinjet.

In February 1981, the project was re-designated A320,<ref name="N&W p.44"/> with efforts focused on the former SA2. During the year, Airbus worked with [[Delta Air Lines]] on a 150-seat aircraft envisioned and required by the airline. The A320 would carry 150 passengers {{Convert|1,860|nmi|km|lk=in}} using fuel from wing fuel tanks only.<ref name="N&W p.44"/> The Dash 200 had more fuel through the activation of centre fuel tank, increasing fuel capacity from {{Convert|3,429|impgal|L|order=flip}} to {{Convert|5,154|impgal|L|abbr=on|order=flip}},<ref name="Eden p.23">{{harvnb|Eden|2008|p=23}}</ref> enabling flights with a distance of {{Convert|2,850|nmi|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name="N&W p.44"/> The aircraft would measure {{convert|36.04|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and {{convert|39.24|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, respectively.<ref name="N&W p.44"/> Airbus then had to decide on a cross-section for the A320. It considered a fuselage diameter of "the Boeing 707 and 727, or do something better".<ref name="FG.com A320"/> It eventually settled on a wider diameter, with the internal width at {{convert|3.7|m|ftin|abbr=on}},<ref name="FG.com A320"/> compared to {{Convert|3.45|m|ftin|abbr=on}}<ref name="FG.com A320"/> of the Boeing aircraft. Although heavier, this specification allowed the aircraft to compete more effectively with the 737. The A320 wing went through several stages of design, finally settling on {{Convert|33.91|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Eden p.23"/> It is long and thin, offering better aerodynamic efficiency because of the higher [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] than the competition, namely the 737 and MD-80.<!--it also feature what Airbus calls "[[Wingtip device|wingtip fences]]".-->

[[File:Turkish Airlines Airbus A321 cockpit Karakas.jpg|thumb|left|The cockpit of the A321 is similar to that of the A318, A319 and A320. This layout would be incorporated into the [[Airbus A330|A330]], [[Airbus A340|A340]], [[Airbus A350|A350]] and [[Airbus A380|A380]]. This "[[commonality]]" enables pilots to quickly transition among these aircraft.]]

With the A320, Airbus made a controversial decision. For the first time, digital [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]] would be incorporated into a commercial airliner,<ref name="N&W p.45">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=45}}</ref> although it was previously successfully proven on military fighter aircraft,<ref name="N&W p.45"/> such as the [[Vought F-8 Crusader]]. Aside from associated reduction in weight and cost, this system would provide [[flight envelope protection]].<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=45–46}}</ref> The pilot, in essence, places inputs into the flight control computer, which interprets these actions and moves the [[flight control surface]]s. FBW also allows Airbus to make flying characteristics similar to later models,<ref name="N&W p.46">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=46}}</ref> such as the [[Airbus A330]], [[Airbus A340|A340]], [[Airbus A380|A380]], and the [[Airbus A350|A350]]. It would feature [[side-stick]] control for the first time on a commercial aircraft. [[Bernard Ziegler]], son of the former Airbus CEO, [[Henri Ziegler]], was the initiator of the aircraft's revolutionary fly-by-wire flight controls with side-stick cockpit controller and full glass cockpit. He successfully convinced aviation authorities of the concept's validity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/farnborough-airbuss-fly-by-wire-pioneer-bernard-ziegler-wins-flightglobal-lifetime-achievement-award-373768/|title=FARNBOROUGH: Airbus's fly-by-wire pioneer Bernard Ziegler wins Flightglobal Lifetime Achievement Award|work=Flight Daily News|date=11 July 2012|accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref>

During the A320 development programme, Airbus considered [[propfan]] technology, backed by [[Lufthansa]].<ref>{{harvnb|Aris|2002|p=122}}</ref> At the time unproven, it was essentially a fan placed outside the engine [[nacelle]], offering speed of a turbofan at [[turboprop]]s economics; eventually, Airbus stuck with turbofans. Power on the A320 would be supplied by two [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56-5-A1s]] rated at 25,000&nbsp;lbf (112.5&nbsp;kN).<ref name="Eden p.23"/> It was the only available engine at launch until the [[IAE V2500]], offered by [[International Aero Engines]], a group composed of [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]], [[Pratt & Whitney]], [[Japanese Aero Engine Corporation]], [[Fiat]] and [[MTU Aero Engines]] (MTU). The first V2500 variant, the V2500-A1, has a thrust output of {{Convert|25,000|lbf|kN|lk=on}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.i-a-e.com/media/facts.pdf |title=V2500 |accessdate=18 February 2011 |work=International Aero Engines |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110712233832/http://www.i-a-e.com/media/facts.pdf |archivedate=12 July 2011 }}</ref> hence the name, and is marginally more efficient than the CFM56, with [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] at 0.560 lb/(lbf·h), compared to 0.591 lb/(lbf·h) of the CFM56.<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=167}}</ref>
<!--
After the [[1970s energy crisis|oil price rises of the 1970s]], Airbus needed to minimise the trip fuel costs of the A320. To that end, it adopted [[Composite material|composite]] primary structures, [[Center of mass|centre-of-gravity]] control using fuel, [[glass cockpit]] ([[Electronic Flight Information Systems|EFIS]]) and a two-crew [[Cockpit|flight deck]]. The end result was that the A320 consumed 50% less fuel than the 727{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. According to a study cited by the Stockholm Environmental Institute, the A320 burns {{Convert|11,608|kg|lb}} of [[Aviation fuel|jet fuel]] flying between Los Angeles and New York City, which is about {{Convert|77.4|kg|lb|1}} per passenger in an A320 with 150 seats.<ref>Gillespie, S.

=== Production and testing ===
[[File:Airbus-Höhenruder.jpg|thumb|The [[horizontal stabilizer]] of the A320 is produced in Spain. Other A320 parts are manufactured at sites throughout Europe and the world.]]

Production of the A320 was postponed for a number of reasons. From the start, the UK, France and [[West Germany]] wanted the responsibility of final assembly and the associated duties. These disputes were known as "work-share arguments",<ref name="Aris p.123">{{harvnb|Aris|2002|p=123}}</ref> driven by, apart from money, prestige.<ref name="Aris p.123"/> The Germans requested an increased work-share of 40%,<ref name="Aris p.123"/> while the British wanted the major responsibilities to be swapped around to give partners production and [[research and development]] (R&D) experience.<ref name="Aris p.123"/> In the end, British work-share was increased from that of the two previous Airbuses,<ref name="Aris p.123"/> while virtually no changes took place for the other three major member-countries. Another contributing factor was launch aid, or subsidies, for the aerospace companies from their respective governments. France was willing to commit, while the Germans were more cautious.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{harvnb|Aris|2002|p=124}}</ref> The UK government, on the other hand, was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling requested by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe). Estimated at [[Pound sterling|₤]]250&nbsp;million, it was postponed for three years until 1 March 1984,<ref name="Eden p.23"/> when an announcement was made about the deal between government and manufacturer. The agreement dictates that ₤50&nbsp;million would be paid whether the A320 would fly or not, while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold.<ref>{{harvnb|Aris|2002|p=126}}</ref>

The programme was launched the following day<ref name="Airbus timeline">{{cite web|title=Timeline 40 Years of Innovation |work=Airbus|url=http://www.airbus.com/fileadmin/media_gallery/files/press_centre/presskits_backgrounders/Airbus_40_years_of_innovation_-_timeline_illustrated.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=14 December 2013}}</ref> off the back of orders for 96 aircraft from five customers.

Final assembly for the A321 would be, as a first for any Airbus, carried out in Germany (then West Germany).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1990/1990%20-%200274.html |title=A321 victory for West Germany |accessdate=24 February 2011 |author =Sebdon, Gilbert |date=7 February 1990 |work=Flight International }}</ref> This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150&nbsp;million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditure associated with the new plant,<ref name="N&W p.53">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=53}}</ref> and the Germans, arguing it would be more productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at [[Hamburg]], which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the [[bond market]], through which it raised $480&nbsp;million (€475 million) to finance development costs.<ref name="Reed p.84"/> An additional $180&nbsp;million (€175 million) was borrowed from [[European Investment Bank]] and private investors.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=52}}</ref>

The [[maiden flight]] of the Airbus A321 came on 11 March 1993, when the [[prototype]], registration F-WWIA, flew with [[IAE V2500]] engines; the second prototype, equipped with CFM56-5B turbofans, flew in May.<ref name="Eden p.25"/> Lufthansa and [[Alitalia]] were the first to order the stretched Airbuses, with 20 and 40 aircraft requested, respectively.<ref name="Eden p.25"/> The first of Lufthansa's V2500-A5-powered A321s arrived on 27 January 1994, while Alitalia received its first CFM56-5B-powered aircraft on 22 March.<ref name="Eden p.25"/>

=== Shrinking the A320: A319 ===
The A319 is the next derivative of the baseline A320. The design is a "shrink" with its origins in the 130- to 140-seat SA1, part of the Single-Aisle studies.<ref name="N&W p.53"/> The SA1 was shelved as the consortium concentrated on its bigger siblings. After healthy sales of the A320/A321, Airbus re-focused on what was then known as the ''A320M-7'', meaning A320 ''minus seven fuselage frames''.<ref>{{harvnb|Eden|2008|p=26}}</ref> It would provide direct competition for the [[Boeing 737-300|737–300]]/[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|-700]].<ref name="N&W p.53"/> The shrink was achieved through the removal of four fuselage frames fore and three aft the wing, cutting the overall length by {{Convert|3.73|m|ftin}}.<ref name="A320 specifications"/><ref name="Meeting demand">{{cite web |author =Moxon, Henley |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1995/1995%20-%202575.html |title=Meeting demands |accessdate=25 February 2011 |date=30 August 1995 |work=Flight International }}</ref><ref name="A319 specifications"/>  Consequently, the number of overwing exits were reduced from four to two.

=== Second shrink: A318 ===
{{Main|Airbus A318#Development|l1=Airbus A318 – Development}}

The A318 was born out of mid-1990 studies between [[Aviation Industry Corporation of China|Aviation Industries of China]] (AVIC), [[ST Aerospace|Singapore Technologies Aerospace]], [[Alenia Aeronautica|Alenia]] and Airbus on a 95- to 125-seat aircraft project. The programme was called the ''AE31X'', and covered the 95-seat AE316 and 115- to 125-seat AE317.<ref name="N&W p.87">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=87}}</ref> The former would have had an overall length of {{Convert|31.3|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, while the AE317 was longer by {{Convert|3.2|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, at {{Convert|34.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.<ref name=AE31X>{{cite journal|author1=Paul Lewis|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1997/1997%20-%203026.html|title=Time out in asia|journal=Flight International|date=5 November 1997|volume=152|issue=4599|page=38,39|publisher=Reed Business Information|issn=0015-3710}}</ref> The engines were to be supplied from two Rolls-Royce BR715s, CFM56-9s, or the Pratt & Whitney PW6000s;<ref name="N&W p.87"/><ref name=AE31X/> with the MTOW of {{Convert|53.3|t|lb|abbr=on}} for the smaller version and {{Convert|58|t|lb|abbr=on}} for the AE317, the thrust requirement were {{Convert|77.9|-|84.6|kN|lbf|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|84.6|-|91.2|kN|lbf|abbr=on}}, respectively.<ref name=AE31X/> Range was settled at {{Convert|5,200|km|nmi|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|5,800|km|nmi|abbr=on}} for the high gross weights of both variants.<ref name=AE31X/> Both share a wingspan of {{Convert|31.0|m|ftin|abbr=on}}<ref name=AE31X/> and a flight deck similar to that of the A320 family.

[[File:British Airways A318.jpg|thumb|A British Airways A318 at London City Airport]]
Simultaneously, Airbus was developing Airbus A318. In early 1998, Airbus revealed its considerations of designing a 100-seat aircraft based on the A320. The AE31X project was terminated by September 1998, after which Airbus officially announced an aircraft of its own, the ''A318'',<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=88}}</ref> at that year's Farnborough Airshow.<ref name="Gunston p.222"/> The aircraft is the smallest product of Airbus's product range, and was developed coincidentally at the same time as the largest commercial aircraft in history, the Airbus A380. First called ''A319M5'' in as early as March 1995, it was shorter by {{Convert|0.79|m|ftin|adj=on}} ahead of the wing and {{Convert|1.6|m|ftin}} behind.<ref name="Gunston p.222">{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=222}}</ref> These cuts reduced passenger capacity from 124 on the A319 to 107 passengers in a two-class layout.<ref name="A318 specifications"/> Range was {{Convert|5,700|km|nmi}}, or {{Convert|5,950|km|nmi}} with upcoming [[Sharklet (wingtip device)|Sharklets]].<ref name="A318 specifications"/><!-- For the first time, laser welding featured prominently during final assembly, eliminating the necessity for heavy rivets and bolts.-->

''A320 Enhanced family'' (or ''A320E family'') is the working title for a series of improvements to the A320 family. The improvements include engine improvements, aerodynamic refinements&nbsp;– such as adding large curved [[Wingtip device|winglets]] (Sharklets), weight savings, and a new cabin design.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2006/06/20/207273/pictures-airbus-aims-to-thwart-boeings-narrowbody-plans-with-upgraded-a320.html |title= Airbus aims to thwart Boeing's narrowbody plans with upgraded 'A320 Enhanced' |publisher=Flight International |date= 20 June 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/avianca-takes-delivery-of-sharklet-equipped-a320/ |title=Avianca takes delivery of Sharklet equipped A320 |work=Airbus |date=13 February 2013 |accessdate=4 July 2013}}</ref>

In 2006, Airbus tested three styles of winglet intended to counteract the wing's [[induced drag]] and [[wingtip vortices]] more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. The first design type to be tested was developed by Airbus and was based on work done by the AWIATOR programme. The second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by Winglet Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas. Two aircraft were used in the flight test evaluation campaign&nbsp;– the prototype A320, which had been retained by Airbus for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of winglets before it was delivered to [[JetBlue]].

Despite the anticipated efficiency gains and development work, Airbus announced that the new winglets will not be offered to customers, claiming that the weight of the modifications required would negate any aerodynamic benefits.<ref name="fi_20061010">{{Cite news|last= Kingsley-Jones|first= Max|title = Airbus rethinks plan to put winglets on A320|work=[[Flight International]] |date = 10 October 2006| url = http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2006/10/10/209738/airbus-rethinks-plan-to-put-winglets-on-a320.html}}</ref> Instead, on 17 December 2008, Airbus announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended winglet design developed by [[Aviation Partners Inc.]] as part of an A320 modernisation programme using the A320 prototype.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/airbus-undertakes-blended-winglet-evaluation-on-a320 |title = Airbus undertakes Blended-Winglet evaluation on A320 |publisher=Airbus |date = 17 December 2008 |accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref>

The Airbus A320 family are [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft]] with a retractable tricycle [[landing gear]] and are powered by two wing pylon-mounted [[turbofan engine]]s.  The Airbus A320 family is the only narrow-body aircraft from Airbus.

=== Airframe ===
[[File:Spirit Airlines NK-319.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Spirit Airlines|Spirit]] A320 being refueled and loaded with luggage]]

The Airbus A320 family are low-wing [[cantilever]] [[monoplane]]s with a conventional [[Empennage|tail unit]] with a single [[vertical stabilizer]] and [[rudder]]. Wing swept back at 25 degrees, optimised for maximum operating [[Mach number]] 0.82.<ref name=" A320 specifications"/> Compared to other airliners of the same class, the A320 features a wider single-aisle cabin of {{convert|3.95|m|in}}<ref name="A320 specifications"/> outside diameter, compared to {{convert|148|in|m}} of the [[Boeing 737|737]] and {{convert|131.6|in|m}} of the [[Boeing 717|717]], and larger overhead bins. In addition, the aircraft has a cargo hold equipped with large doors to assist in expedient loading and unloading of goods.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The Airbus A320 is the first narrow body airliner to have a significant amount of its structure made from [[composite material]]. Its [[Empennage|tail assembly]] made almost entirely of such material by CASA,<ref name="N&W p.42">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=42}}</ref> who also builds the elevators, main landing gear doors, and rear fuselage parts.<ref name="N&W p.42"/>

=== Flight deck and avionics ===
The A320 was the first civil airliner to include a full digital [[fly-by-wire]] flight control system.  Its design also included a full [[glass cockpit]] rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners.  Digital [[head-up display]]s are available.<ref>[https://www1.online.thalesgroup.com/col/Air_Transport/fiche_bfe/d_huds.html DIGITAL HEAD-UP DISPLAY SYSTEM] Thales {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

[[File:Airbus-319-cockpit.jpg|thumb|The Airbus A320 family was the first commercial airliner to feature a full [[glass cockpit]] and digital [[fly-by-wire]] flight control system. The only analogue instruments are the [[Radio direction finder#Radio-magnetic indicator (RMI)|RMI]] (backup [[Attitude indicator|ADI]] on earlier models, replaced by digital [[Integrated Standby Instrument System|ISIS]] on later models) and brake pressure indicator.]]
The A320's [[Cockpit|flight deck]] is equipped with [[Electronic Flight Instrument System]] (EFIS) with side-stick controllers. At the time of the aircraft's introduction, the behaviour of the fly-by-wire system (equipped with full [[flight envelope protection]]) was a new experience for many pilots. The A320 features an [[Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor]] (ECAM) which gives the flight crew information about all the systems of the aircraft. With the exception of the very earliest A320s, most can be upgraded to the latest avionics standards, keeping the aircraft advanced even after two decades in service.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Early A320 planes used the [[Intel 80186]] and [[Motorola 68010]],<ref>Section 4.2 "Failure detection and redundancy" of Briere D. and Traverse, P.

Newer{{When|date=April 2009}} Airbus feature LCD (liquid crystal display) units in the flight deck of its A318, A319, A320, and A321 flight decks instead of the original CRT ([[cathode ray tube]]) displays. These include the main displays and the backup [[artificial horizon]], which was an analog display prior to this.

=== Engines ===
Three suppliers provide [[turbofan]] engines for the A320 series: [[CFM International]] with its [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56]], [[International Aero Engines]], offering the [[International Aero Engines V2500|V2500]] and [[Pratt & Whitney]] whose [[Pratt & Whitney PW6000|PW6000]] engines are only available for the A318 variant.<ref>{{cite web|title=P&W Main Website |url=http://www.pw.utc.com/products/commercial/pw6000.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120609072558/http://www.pw.utc.com:80/products/commercial/pw6000.asp |archivedate=9 June 2012 }}</ref>

== Operational history ==
[[File:Airbus A319 left wing during the landing. S7 Airlines, Moscow-Pavlodar. May 2009.JPG|thumb|A319 left wing with spoilers deployed during landing. [[S7 Airlines]], Moscow-Pavlodar.]]
The [[Joint Aviation Authorities]] (JAA) issued the [[type certificate]] for the A320 on 26 February 1988. After entering the market in March 1988 with Air France and Ansett, the former Australian domestic airline,<!-- It first entered commercial service with Air France on 18 April 1988. --> Airbus then expanded the A320 family rapidly, launching the 185-seat A321 in 1989 and first delivered it in 1994; launching the 124-seat A319 in 1993 and delivering it in 1996; and launching the 107-seat A318 in 1999 with first deliveries in 2003.<ref>[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]], 29 October 2007, p. 63</ref>

=== Competition ===
The A320 family was developed to compete with the [[Boeing 737|737]] Classics (−300/-400/-500) and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80/90 series, and has since faced challenges from the [[Boeing 737 Next Generation]] (−600/-700/-800/-900) and the [[Boeing 717|717]] during its two decades in service. As of 2010, as well as the [[Boeing 737|737]], the A320 family faces competition from [[Embraer]]'s [[Embraer E-Jets|E-195]] (to the A318), and the [[Bombardier CSeries|CSeries]] being developed by [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/business/worldbusiness/14air.html|title=A New Bombardier Jet Draws Only Tepid Demand|work=New York Times |date=14 July 2008|accessdate=4 April 2010|first=Micheline|last=Maynard}}</ref> to the A318/A319.

===Overview===
The baseline A320 has given rise to a family of aircraft which share a common design but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the A318,<ref name="A318 specifications"/> to 220, on the A321.<ref name="A321 specifications"/> They compete with the [[Boeing 737|737]], [[Boeing 757|757]], and [[Boeing 717|717]]. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot [[type rating]]. Today all variants are available as [[Airbus Corporate Jets|corporate jets]]. [[American Airlines]] is the world's largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 331 airframes in service as of April 2015.<ref name="Airbus_Orders"/>

Technically, the name "A320" only refers to the original mid-sized aircraft, but it is often informally used to indicate any of the A318/A319/A320/A321 family. All variants are able to be [[ETOPS/LROPS|ETOPS]] (Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) certified for [[ETOPS#ETOPS extensions|180 minutes]] since 2004 ([[European Aviation Safety Agency|EASA]]) and 2006 ([[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]).<ref>[http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/airbus-a320-family-approved-for-180-minute-etops-by-the-faa/ Airbus A320 Family approved for 180 minute ETOPS by the FAA] Airbus</ref>  With launch of the new Airbus A320neo project, the previous members of the Airbus A320 family received the "current engine option" or "CEO" name.

=== A320 ===
[[File:Airfrance.a320-200.f-glgm.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Air France]] was the launch customer of the Airbus A320]]

The A320 series has two variants, the ''A320-100'' and ''A320-200''. Only 21 A320-100s were produced;<ref name="N&W p.50"/> these aircraft, the first to be manufactured, were only delivered to [[Air Inter]] (later acquired by [[Air France]]) and [[British Airways]] (as a result of an order from [[British Caledonian Airways]] made prior to its acquisition by British Airways).  Compared to the A320-100, the primary changes on A320-200 are [[Wingtip device#Wingtip fence|wingtip fences]] and increased fuel capacity for increased range. [[Indian Airlines]] used its first 31 A320-200s with double-bogie main [[landing gear]] for airfields with poor runway condition which a single-bogie main gear could not manage. <!--Five of the last A320-100 aircraft, operated by British Airways, were disposed of at the end of 2007{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. The final A320-100, operated by Air France was retired in 2010.--> Typical range with 150 passengers for the A320-200 is about 3,300 nmi (6,150&nbsp;km). It is powered by two [[CFM International|CFMI]] [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56-5s]] or [[IAE V2500]]s with thrust ratings between {{Convert|113|to|120|kN|lbf|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.  The lowest speed an A320 can fly is approximately {{nowrap|207 km/h}}<!-- 112 knots -->.<ref>TV channel: National Geographics. Program: Air Crash Investigation [[List of Mayday episodes#Season 9 (2009)|s9p3]]. ~30 min in.</ref>

A total of 4,242 of the A320ceo model have been delivered, with 519 remaining on order as of 31 May 2016.<ref name=AirbusOrd&Del/>  The direct Boeing competitor is the [[737-800]].

=== A321 ===
[[File:Airbus A321 - myAustrian (1).jpg|thumb|left|An [[Austrian Airlines]] Airbus A321]]

The Airbus A321 is a stretched first derivative of the standard A320.  The variant was launched in 1988,<ref name="N&W p.50"/> when the A320 began operations.  Compared with the A320, the A321's major change is the stretched fuselage, which is lengthened by {{Convert|6.94|m|ftin}}; the A321 is the largest of the A320 family.<ref name="A320 specifications"/><ref name="A321 specifications"/> This is achieved by adding a {{Convert|4.27|m|ftin|abbr=on|adj=on}} front plug immediately forward of wing, and a {{Convert|2.67|m|ftin|abbr=on|adj=on}} rear plug.<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|pp=213–214}}</ref> To maintain performance, double-slotted flaps were included, in addition to increasing the wing area by {{Convert|4|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, to {{Convert|128|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="A321 described"/> Other minor modifications were made to accommodate the A321-100's {{Convert|9,600|kg|lb|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} increase in maximum takeoff weight to {{Convert|83,000|kg|lb|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.<ref name="N&W p.51"/>  The maiden flight of the first of two prototypes came on 11 March 1993.<ref name="Eden p.25"/>  The A321-100 entered service in January 1994 with Lufthansa.

The basic A321-100 features a reduction in range compared to the A320 as extra fuel tankage was not added to the initial design to compensate for the extra weight. Consequently, Airbus launched the heavier and longer range A321-200 development in 1995 which has a full-passenger transcontinental US range. This is achieved through higher thrust engines (V2533-A5 or CFM56-5B3), minor structural strengthening, and an increase in fuel capacity with the installation of one or two optional {{Convert|2,990|L|USgal|adj=on|abbr=on}} tanks in the rear underfloor hold.<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|pp=214–215}}</ref> The additional fuel tankage increases the total capacity of this model to {{Convert|30,030|L|USgal|adj=on|abbr=on}}. These modifications also increased the maximum takeoff weight of the A321-200 to {{Convert|93,000|kg|lb|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. This variant first flew in December 1996, and entered service with [[Monarch Airlines]] in April 1997. Its direct competitors include the [[Boeing 757|757–200]] and the [[Boeing 737|737-900/900ER]].

Airbus announced the development of a longer range version named A321neoLR that will be available in 2019. It is positioned to replace the [[Boeing 757|757–200]] in transatlantic and similar markets where the range and payload of the [[Boeing 737|737–900]] is insufficient to replace the [[Boeing 757|757–200]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://leehamnews.com/2014/10/21/exclusive-airbus-launches-a321neolr-long-range-to-replace-757-200w/ |title=Exclusive: Airbus launches "A321neoLR" long range to replace 757-200W |date=n.d. |work=Leeham News and Comment |accessdate=26 December 2014}}</ref> The new A321LR will have 206 seats; Business Class will offer 16 seats with 36" pitch and Economy will offer 190 seats at a 30-inch pitch. Airbus claims the maximum range at full payload of 4,000 nautical miles will exceed the range of Boeing's winglet-equipped [[Boeing 757|757–200]] while burning less fuel per passenger. The A321LR will be equipped with three auxiliary fuel tanks including one at centerline. Boeing has not stated how it will replace the [[Boeing 757|757]],<ref>Flottau, Jens, and Guy Norris, Filling the gap, Aviation Week & Space Technology, 15 January – 1 February 2015, p.24</ref> but is not working on a "[[Boeing 757|757]] MAX", or a longer range 737-9 MAX.<ref>[http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/boeing-sees-no-business-case-757-max Boeing Sees No Business Case For 757 MAX] Aviation Week</ref><ref>[http://www.todayonline.com/business/exclusive-boeing-says-it-has-no-plans-long-range-737-max Exclusive: Boeing says it has no plans for long-range 737 MAX] Today</ref>

=== A319 ===
[[File:Lufthansa.a319-100.d-aili.arp.jpg|thumb|A [[Lufthansa]] Airbus A319]]

The A319 is a shortened, minimum-change version of the A320. Also known as the A320M-7, it is {{Convert|3.73|m|ftin}} shorter than the A320;<ref name="A320 specifications"/><ref name="Meeting demand"/><ref name="A319 specifications"/> four frames fore of the wing and three frames aft of the wing were removed. The reduced seating reduces the emergency exits to six.  With virtually the same fuel capacity as the A320-200, and fewer passengers, the range with 124 passengers in a two-class configuration extends to {{Convert|6,650|km|nmi|abbr=on}}, or {{Convert|6,850|km|nmi|abbr=on}} with the "Sharklets".<ref name="A319 specifications"/> Four propulsion options available on the A319 are the {{Convert|23,040|lbf|kN|adj=on}} V2522-A5 and {{Convert|24,800|lbf|kN|adj=on}} V2527M-A5 from IAE, or the {{Convert|22,000|lbf|kN|adj=on}} CFM56-5B/A and {{Convert|27,000|lbf|kN|adj=on}} CFM56-5B7.<ref name="Gunston 2009 216"/> Although identical to those of the A320, these engines are derated because of the A319's lower MTOW.

The A319 was developed at the request of [[Steven F. Udvar-Házy|Steven Udvar-Hazy]], the former president and CEO of [[ILFC]] according to ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/business/10flyboy.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1 |title=The Real Owner of All Those Planes |accessdate=4 March 2011 |author =Wayne, Leslie |date=10 May 2007 |work=The New York Times |page=2}}</ref> The A319's launch customer, in fact, was ILFC, which had placed an order for six A319s by 1993.<ref name="N&W p.54" /> Anticipating further orders by Swissair and Alitalia, Airbus decided to launch the programme on 10 June 1993.  Final assembly of the first A319 began on 23 March 1995<ref name="Eden pp.26-27">{{harvnb|Eden|2008|pp=26–27}}</ref> and it was first introduced with Lufthansa in July 1996. The direct [[Boeing]] competitor is the [[Boeing 737-700]].

A total of 1,455 of the A319ceo model have been delivered, with 17 remaining on order as of 31 May 2016.<ref name=AirbusOrd&Del/>

The aircraft seats up to 39 passengers, but may be outfitted by the customers into any configuration. Tyrolean Jet Service Mfg. GmbH & CO KG, [[MJET]] and [[Reliance Industries]] are among its users. The A319CJ competes with other ultralarge-cabin corporate jets such as the Boeing [[Boeing 737#737-700|737–700]]-based [[Boeing Business Jet]] (BBJ) and [[Embraer]] [[Lineage 1000]], as well as with large-cabin and ultralong-range [[Gulfstream G650]], [[Gulfstream G550]] and [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]]'s [[Global 6000]]. It is powered by the same engine types as the A320. The A319CJ was used by the ''[[Escadron de transport, d'entrainement et de calibration|Escadron de Transport, d'Entraînement et de Calibration]]'' which is in charge of transportation for France's officials and also by the Flugbereitschaft of the [[German Air Force]] for transportation of Germany's officials.

=== A318 ===
{{Main|Airbus A318}}
[[File:Avianca Airbus A318 Ramirez.jpg|thumb|left|[[Avianca]] A318]]

The Airbus A318 is the smallest member of the Airbus A320 family. The A318 carries up to 132 passengers and has a maximum range of 3,100 nmi (5,700&nbsp;km; 3,600&nbsp;mi). The aircraft entered service in July 2003 with Frontier Airlines, and shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. It is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency for steep approach operations, allowing flights at airports such as [[London City Airport]]. Relative to other Airbus A320 family variants, the A318 has sold in only small numbers with total orders for only 80 aircraft placed {{asof|2015|10|31|lc=on}}.

=== Freighter ===
A programme to convert A320 and A321 aircraft into freighters was set up by Airbus Freighter Conversion GmbH. Airframes would be converted by [[EADS EFW]] in [[Dresden]], Germany, and [[Zhukovsky (city)|Zhukovsky]], Russia. The launch customer [[Cerberus Capital Management|AerCap]] signed a firm contract on 16 July 2008 to convert 30 of AerCap's passenger A320/A321s into A320/A321P2F (passenger to freighter). However, on 3 June 2011, Airbus announced all partners would end the passenger to freighter programme, citing high demand for used airframes for passenger service.<ref>[http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/strong-demand-for-used-airbus-a320-aircraft-drives-joint-decision-to-stop-freighter-conversion-progr/ "Strong demand for used Airbus A320 aircraft drives joint decision to stop freighter conversion programme"]. airbus.com</ref>

On 17 June 2015, [[ST Aerospace]], signed agreements with Airbus and [[EADS EFW]] for a collaboration to launch the A320/A321 passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion programme.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.staero.aero/downloads/2015/ST%20Aerospace,%20Airbus%20and%20EFW%20to%20launch%20A320%20and%20A321P2F%20conversion%20programme.pdf |title=ST Aerospace, Airbus and EFW to launch A320 and A321P2F conversion programme |publisher=ST Aerospace |date=17 June 2015 |accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref>

The '''Airbus A330''' is a medium to long range [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body]] [[Twinjet|twin-engine]] [[jet airliner]] made by [[Airbus]], a division of [[Airbus Group]]. Versions of the A330 have a [[Range (aircraft)|range]] of {{Convert|5600|to|13430|km|nmi mi|sigfig=3|lk=on}} and can accommodate up to 335 passengers in a [[Travel class|two-class layout]] or carry {{Convert|70|t|lb|sigfig=3}} of cargo.

The A330's origin dates to the mid-1970s as one of several conceived derivatives of Airbus's first airliner, the [[Airbus A300|A300]].  The A330 was developed in parallel with the four-engine [[Airbus A340|A340]], which shared many common [[airframe]] components but differed in number of engines.  Both airliners incorporated [[fly-by-wire]] flight control technology, first introduced on an Airbus aircraft with the [[Airbus A320 family|A320]], as well as the A320's six-display [[glass cockpit]]. In June 1987, after receiving orders from various customers, Airbus launched the A330 and A340. The A330 was Airbus's first airliner that offered a choice of three engines: General Electric CF6, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, and Rolls-Royce Trent 700.

The A330-300, the first variant, took its maiden flight in November 1992 and entered passenger service with [[Air Inter]] in January 1994. Responding to dwindling sales, Airbus followed up with the slightly shorter A330-200 variant in 1998. Subsequently developed A330 variants include a dedicated [[Cargo aircraft|freighter]], the A330-200F, and a military [[Aerial refueling|tanker]], the [[Airbus A330 MRTT|A330 MRTT]]. The A330 MRTT formed the basis of the proposed [[EADS/Northrop Grumman KC-45|KC-45]], entered into the US Air Force's [[KC-X]] competition in conjunction with [[Northrop Grumman]], where after an initial win, on appeal lost to Boeing's tanker.

Since its launch, the A330 has allowed Airbus to expand market share in wide-body airliners.  Competing twinjets include the [[Boeing 767]] and [[Boeing 777|777]], along with the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787]], which entered service in late 2011. The long-range  [[Airbus A350 XWB]] was to succeed both the A330 and A340. The current A330 (referred to as the '''A330ceo''' (current engine option) since 2014) is to be replaced by the [[A330neo]], which includes new engines and other improvements.<ref name=Airbus1>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.airbus.com/newsevents/news-events-single/detail/airbus-launches-the-a330neo/ |title=Airbus launches the A330neo |publisher=Airbus.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name=Airbus3>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.airbus.com/newsevents/news-events-single/detail/living-up-to-its-billing-airbus-officially-launches-the-a330neo-programme/ |title=Living up to its billing: Airbus officially launches the A330neo programme |publisher=Airbus.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name=Airbus2>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.airbus.com/newsevents/news-events-single/detail/farnborough-airshow-2014/ |title=A330neo: Powering into the next decade |publisher=Airbus.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>  {{As of|2015|10}}, A330ceo orders stand at 1,439, of which 1,230 have been delivered.

Airbus's first airliner, the A300, was envisioned as part of a diverse family of commercial aircraft. In pursuit of this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p9-18>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=9–18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|p=63}}</ref> Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations named A300B1 through B9.<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=183}}</ref> A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range [[Airbus A310]].<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p18-9/> Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving of a family of airliners later known as the [[Airbus A320 family]], the first commercial aircraft with digital [[fly-by-wire]] controls. During the SA studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p18-9>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=18–19}}</ref>

In the mid-1970s Airbus began development of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful [[turbofan engine]]s available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p22-3>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=22–23}}</ref> Offering the same range and payload as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency,<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p22-3/> the B9 was seen as a viable replacement for the DC-10 and the [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] trijets.<ref>''Flight International'' 1981, p. 1155.</ref> It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300.<ref name="N&W p.23"/>

At the same time, a 200-seat four-engine version, the B11 (which would eventually become the A340) was also under development.<ref name="Eden p.30">{{harnvb|Eden|2008|p=30}}</ref> The B11 was originally planned to take the place of narrow-body [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Douglas DC-8]]s then in commercial use, but would later evolve to target the long-range, wide-body trijet replacement market.<ref name="N&W p.23">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=23}}</ref> To differentiate from the SA series, the B9 and B11 were re-designated as the TA9 and TA11, with TA standing for "twin aisle".<ref name="Eden p.30"/> Development costs were reduced by the two aircraft using the same [[fuselage]] and wing, with projected savings of US$500&nbsp;million.  Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, those of prospective customers; twinjets were favoured in North America, quad-jets desired in Asia, and operators had mixed views in Europe.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p22-3/> Airbus ultimately found that most potential customers favoured four engines due to their exemption from existing twinjet range restrictions and their ability to be ferried with one inactive engine.<ref name=kingsley>Kingsley-Jones 1997, p. 29.</ref> As a result, development plans prioritised the four-engined TA11 ahead of the TA9.<ref name=kingsley/>

=== Design effort ===
The first specifications for the TA9 and TA11, aircraft that could accommodate 410 passengers in a one-class layout, emerged in 1982.<ref name="N&W p.24">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=24.}}</ref> They showed a large underfloor cargo area that could hold five cargo pallets or sixteen [[Unit Load Device|LD3]] cargo containers in the forward, and four pallets or fourteen LD3s in the aft hold—double the capacity of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar or DC-10, and {{Convert|8.46|m|ft|sigfig=3}} longer than the Airbus A300.<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p24-5>{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=24–25.}}</ref> By June 1985, the TA9 and TA11 had received more improvements, including the adoption of the A320 [[flight deck]], digital fly-by-wire (FBW) control system, and [[side-stick]] control.<ref name="N&W p.27">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=27.}}</ref> Airbus had developed a common cockpit for their aircraft models to allow quick transition by pilots.  The flight crews could transition from one type to another after only one week's training, which reduces operator costs.<ref name="Lawrence p.73">{{harvnb|Lawrence|Thornton|2005|p=73.}}</ref> The two TAs would use the [[vertical stabiliser]], [[rudder]], and circular fuselage sections of the A300-600, extended by two barrel sections.<ref name="Lawrence p.73"/>

Airbus briefly considered the [[variable camber wing]], a concept that requires changing the wing profile for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe), now part of [[BAE Systems]], at [[Hatfield Aerodrome|Hatfield]] and [[Filton Aerodrome|Bristol]]. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency,<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=26, 31.}}</ref> but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development.<ref name="Eden p.30"/> A true [[laminar flow]] wing (a low-drag shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected.<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=196.}}</ref>

[[File:Egyptengine.jpg|thumb|The A330 was the first Airbus aircraft on which Rolls-Royce supplied engines, with its [[Trent 700]] turbofans.<ref name="N&W p.44">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=44.}}</ref> This engine is from an [[EgyptAir]] A330 in late 1990s-mid-2000s-era livery.|alt=A mostly blue jet engine suspended on a wing; it is characterised by its smooth nacelle, or outer casing.]]

From the beginning of the TA9's development, a choice of [[aircraft engines|engines]] from the three major engine manufacturers, [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]], [[Pratt & Whitney]], and [[GE Aviation]], was planned.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|=44}}</ref> GE Aviation first offered the [[General Electric CF6#CF6-80C2|General Electric CF6-80C2]]. However, later studies indicated that more thrust was needed to increase the initial power capability from {{Convert|267|to|289|kN|lbf|abbr=on|lk=on|sigfig=3}}.<ref name="N&W pp.44-45">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=44–45.}}</ref> GE enlarged the CF6-80C2 fan from {{Convert|236|to|244|cm|in|sigfig=3}} to create the [[General Electric CF6#CF6-80E1|CF6-80E1]], giving a new thrust output of {{Convert|300|-|320|kN|lbf|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Model CF6-80E1|publisher=GE Aviation|url=http://www.geae.com/engines/commercial/cf6/cf6-80e1.html|accessdate=25 January 2011}}</ref> Rolls-Royce initially wanted to use the {{Convert|267|kN|lbf|adj=on|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[Rolls-Royce Trent#Trent 600 – First proposal|Trent 600]] to power Airbus's newest twinjet and the upcoming [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]]. However, the company later agreed to develop an engine solely for the A330, the [[Rolls-Royce Trent 700|Trent 700]], with a larger diameter and {{Convert|311|kN|lbf|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} of thrust.<ref name="N&W p.47">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=47.}}</ref> Similarly, Pratt & Whitney signed an agreement that covered the development of the A330-only [[Pratt & Whitney PW4000|PW4168]]. The company increased the fan size to augment power,<ref name=Nor_Wagn_p44-46>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=45–46.}}</ref> enabling the engine to deliver {{Convert|311|kN|lbf|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} of thrust.<ref name=PW4000>{{cite web|title=PW4000-100|publisher=Pratt & Whitney|url=http://www.pw.utc.com/PW4000100_Engine|accessdate=2015-07-04}}</ref>

On 27 January 1986, the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in [[Munich]], West Germany. Afterwards, the board chairman, [[Franz Josef Strauß]], released a statement that said, "Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments". The designations were originally reversed; they were switched so the quad-jet airliner would have a "4" in its name. Airbus hoped for five airlines to sign for both the A330 and A340, and on 12 May sent sale proposals to the most likely candidates, including [[Lufthansa]] and [[Swissair]].<ref name="N&W p.27"/>

=== Production and testing ===
In preparation to produce the A330 and A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. In England, BAe made a [[Pound sterling|£]]7&nbsp;million investment in a three-storey technical centre with {{Convert|15000|m2|sqft|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} of floor area at [[Filton]].<ref name="N&W p.51">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=51.}}</ref> BAe also spent £5&nbsp;million on a new production line at its [[Chester]] wing production plant.<ref name="N&W p.51"/> In Germany, [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm]] (MBB) invested [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]400&nbsp;million ($225&nbsp;million) on manufacturing facilities in the [[Weser]] estuary, including at [[Bremen]], Einswarden, [[Varel]], and [[Hamburg]].<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=53–54.}}</ref> France saw the biggest investments, with [[Aérospatiale]] constructing a new [[French franc|Fr.]]2.5&nbsp;billion ($411&nbsp;million) final-assembly plant adjacent to [[Toulouse-Blagnac Airport]] in [[Colomiers]]; by November 1988, the pillars for the new ''[[Clément Ader]]'' assembly hall had been erected.<ref name="N&W p.52">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=52.}}</ref> The assembly process featured increased automation, such as robots drilling holes and installing fasteners during the wing-to-fuselage mating process.<ref name="N&W p.53">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=53.}}</ref>

On 12 March 1987, Airbus received the first orders for the twinjet. The domestic French airline [[Air Inter]] placed five firm orders and fifteen [[Option (aircraft purchasing)|options]], while [[Thai Airways International]] requested eight aircraft, split evenly between firm orders and options.<ref name=kingsley/><ref name="N&W p.31">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=31.}}</ref> Airbus announced the next day that it would formally launch the A330 and A340 programmes by April 1987, with deliveries of the A340 to begin in May 1992 and A330 deliveries to start in 1993. [[Northwest Airlines]] signed a letter of intent for twenty A340s and ten A330s on 31 March.<ref name="N&W p.31"/>

BAe eventually received £450&nbsp;million of funding from the UK government, well short of the £750&nbsp;million it had originally requested for the design and construction of the wings.<ref name="N&W p.32">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=32.}}</ref> The German and French governments also provided funding. Airbus issued subcontracts to companies in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Greece, Italy, India, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, the United States, and the former Yugoslavia.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=32, 55.}}</ref> With funding in place, Airbus launched the A330 and A340 programmes on 5 June 1987, just prior to the [[Paris Air Show]].<ref name="N&W p.32"/><ref>{{cite web |title= Timeline 40 Years of Innovation |publisher= Airbus S.A.S |url= http://www.airbus.com/fileadmin/media_gallery/files/press_centre/presskits_backgrounders/Airbus_40_years_of_innovation_-_timeline_illustrated.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate=2 March 2011 |page=2}}</ref> At that time, the order book stood at 130 aircraft from ten customers, including lessor [[International Lease Finance Corporation]] (ILFC). Of the order total, forty-one were for A330s.<ref name="N&W p.32"/> In 1989, Asian carrier [[Cathay Pacific]] joined the list of purchasers, ordering nine A330s and later increasing this number to eleven.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eden|2008|p=32.}}</ref>

The wing-to-fuselage mating of the first A330, the tenth airframe of the A330 and A340 line, began in mid-February 1992. This aircraft, coated with anti-corrosion paint, was rolled out on 31 March without its General Electric CF6-80E1 engines, which were installed by August. During a static test, the wing failed just below requirement, BAe engineers later solved the problem.<ref name="N&W p.78-79"/> At the 1992 [[Farnborough Airshow]], Northwest deferred delivery of sixteen A330s to 1994, following the cancellation of its A340 orders.<ref name="N&W p.78">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=71, 78.}}</ref>

[[File:Dragonair.Airbus A330-300.Economy class.2010.JPG|thumb|A330-300 interior, economy class]]
The first completed A330 was rolled out on 14 October 1992, with the [[maiden flight]] following on 2 November. Weighing {{Convert|181840|kg|lb|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}, including {{Convert|20980|kg|lb|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} of test equipment,<ref name="N&W p.78-79"/> the A330 became the biggest twinjet to have flown, until the later first flight of the [[Boeing 777]]. The flight lasted five hours and fifteen minutes during which speed, height, and other flight configurations were tested. Airbus intended the test flight programme to comprise six aircraft flying a total of 1,800 hours.<ref name="N&W p.78-79">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=78–79.}}</ref> On 21 October 1993, the Airbus A330 received the European [[Joint Aviation Authorities]] (JAA) and US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) certifications simultaneously after 1,114 cumulative airborne test hours and 426 test flights. At the same time, weight tests came in favourable, showing the plane was {{Convert|500|kg|lb|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} under weight.<!--This coincided with the revelation of weight test results showing the aircraft was {{Convert|500|kg|lb|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} under its expected weight--><ref name="N&W p.85">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=85.}}</ref>

On 30 June 1994, [[1994 A330 test flight crash|trouble struck]] during certification of the Pratt & Whitney engine when an A330 crashed near Toulouse.<ref>{{cite web |title= Accident description |publisher= Aviation-Safety.net |date= 24 January 2011 |url= http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19940630-0 |accessdate=25 January 2011}}</ref> Both pilots and the five passengers died.<ref name="N&W pp.86-87">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=86–87.}}</ref> The flight was designed to test [[autopilot]] response during a one-engine-off worst-case scenario with the [[Center of gravity of an aircraft|centre of gravity]] near its [[Center of gravity of an aircraft#CG aft of aft limit|aft limit]].

[[Air Inter]] became the first operator of the A330, putting the aircraft into service on 17 January 1994 between [[Orly Airport]], Paris, and [[Marseille]].<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=84–85.}}</ref> Deliveries to [[Malaysia Airlines]] (MAS) and Thai Airways International were postponed to address [[delamination]] of the [[composite material]]s in the PW4168 engine's [[Thrust reversal|thrust reverser]] assembly.

Airbus intended the A330 to compete in the [[ETOPS|Extended-range Twin-engine Operation Performance Standards]] (ETOPS) market, specifically with the Boeing 767.<ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|page= 65}}</ref> (ETOPS is a standard that allows longer range flights away from a diversion airport for aircraft that have met special design and testing standards.) Instead of the "ETOPS out of the box" or "Early ETOPS" approach taken by Boeing with its 777,<ref group=Nb>This meant that the Boeing 777 was certified for 180-minutes ETOPS from the first day of service.

=== Further developments ===
In response to a decline in A330-300 sales, increased market penetration by the [[Boeing 767-300ER]], and airline requests for increased range and smaller aircraft, Airbus developed the Airbus A330-200.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=91.}}</ref> Known as the A329 and A330M10 during development, the A330-200 would offer nine per cent lower operating costs than the Boeing 767-300ER.<ref name="N&W pp.92-93"/> The plane was aimed at the {{Convert|11900|km|nmi mi|adj=on|abbr=on|sigfig=3|lk=out}} sector, where Airbus predicted demand for 800 aircraft between 1995 and 2015.<ref name="N&W pp.92-93">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=92–93.}}</ref> The project, with US$450&nbsp;million in expected development costs, was approved by the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board on 24 November 1995.<ref name="N&W pp.92-93"/>

As Airbus worked on its A330-200, [[hydraulic pump]] problems were reported by both A330 and A340 operators. This issue was the suspected cause of a fire that destroyed an [[Air France]] A340-200 in January 1994.<ref name="N&W p.96"/> On 4 January that year, a Malaysia Airlines A330-300, while undergoing regular maintenance at [[Singapore Changi Airport]], was consumed by a fire that started in the right-hand main undercarriage well.

Several in-flight shutdowns of Trent 700–powered A330-300s occurred. On 11 November 1996, engine failure on a Cathay Pacific flight forced it back to [[Ho Chi Minh City]].<ref>Lewis 1996, p. 9.</ref> On 17 April 1997, Cathay Pacific's subsidiary [[Dragonair]] experienced an engine shutdown on an A330, caused by carbon clogging the [[oil filter]]. As a result, Cathay Pacific self-suspended its 120-minute ETOPS clearance.  Another engine failure occurred on 6 May during [[climb (aeronautics)|climbout]] with a Cathay Pacific A330, due to a bearing failure in a [[Hispano-Suiza]]-built [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]]. Three days later, a Cathay Pacific A330 on climbout during a Bangkok–Hong Kong flight experienced an oil pressure drop and a resultant [[Flameout|engine spool down]], forcing a return to Bangkok.

In December 2014, Airbus announced that it would reduce A330 production to nine aircraft per month from ten, because of falling orders. Airbus did not rule out further production cuts.  The announcement led to an immediate drop in Airbus Group's stock price because the company derives a significant percentage of its cash flow and net profit from the A330 program; the A330's financial impact is magnified amid problems in the [[Airbus A350|A350]] and [[Airbus A380|A380]] programs.<ref>Wall, Robert, "Airbus plans to cut A330 output", Wall Street Journal, 11 December 2014, p.

===A330neo===
{{Main|Airbus A330neo}}

Airbus' management has been studying whether to equip the A330 with newer, more efficient engines: "new engine option" or neo. Airbus sales chief [[John Leahy (executive)|John Leahy]]'s argument is that the lower purchase price of an A330 even without new engines make the economics of buying an A330 competitive at midrange routes with that of the Boeing 787.<ref name=AW_Delta_issue/>  Leahy stated that "we just reduced the capital costs by 25%" in July 2014.<ref>Wall, Robert, and Jon Ostrower. "From big jet makers, smaller changes". Wall Street Journal, 15 July 2014, p. B3.</ref>  Candidate engines include variants of Rolls-Royce's [[Rolls-Royce Trent 1000|Trent 1000]] and General Electric's [[General Electric GEnx|GEnx-1B]].  Both engine makers are reportedly interested in winning an exclusive deal should a re-engined A330 be offered. The Trent 1000 TEN (Thrust, Efficiency, New Technology) engine is under development for the 787-10, but Rolls-Royce intends to offer it for a number of aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |author= Jens Flottau and Guy Norris |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/reengining-airbus-a330-could-take-2-3-years |title= Reengining Airbus A330 Could Take 2–3 Years |publisher= Aviation Week and Space Technology  |date= 31 Jan 2014}}</ref> Both engines are heavier than the A330's existing engines, so Airbus will have to strengthen the wings to accept them.<ref name=AW_CIT_pushes/>

Airbus believes the A330neo derives much of its market advantage from being a less expensive widebody positioned to serve high density routes shorter than 4,000 nautical miles that otherwise would be served by aircraft primarily designed for routes of 8,000 miles.  Ed Greenslet, editor of Airline Monitor, told Aviation Week that the A330neo could create a monopoly in that segment, because the 767 is "essentially out of production" and the only other aircraft suited for it is the [[Boeing 757]]; the largest 737 does not have the passenger capacity to compete effectively.<ref name="auto">Flottau, Jens, "Defining priorities", Aviation Week and Space Technology, 14 July 2014, p. 70.</ref>

It specifically cites the A350-800 as "not as efficient as they'd like." On the other hand, [[Steven Udvar-Hazy]], chairman of Air Lease Corp. does not accept that reasoning, telling Aviation Week "We don't believe it is rational for us to take the A350-800 and the A330neo...I don't see the A350-800 surviving if (Airbus) does the A330neo."<ref name=AW_CIT_pushes>{{cite web |title= CIT Pushes Case For A330neo |url= http://aviationweek.com/awin/cit-pushes-case-a330neo |author= Norris, Guy |publisher= Aviation Week and Space Technology |date= 24 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/airbus-more-1000-orders-coming-a330neo|title=Airbus: More Than 1,000 Orders Coming For A330neo|work=aviationweek.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>

Airbus is also considering re-engining the [[Airbus A380|A380]], but running two costly upgrade programs at the same time could overwhelm the company's resources.

The decision to offer the aircraft with only one engine is somewhat controversial but not unique to Airbus; the [[Boeing 777X]] will come equipped exclusively with General Electric engines.  On the one hand, airlines bemoan the loss of competition among engine makers; Steven Udvar-Hazy, CEO of Air Lease Corp., said that he wants a choice of engines.  On the other hand, Airbus has pointed out that equipping a commercial aircraft to handle more than one type of engine adds millions of dollars to the purchase price.  A [[Pratt and Whitney]] executive told the Wall Street Journal, "Engines are no longer commodities...the optimization of the engine and the aircraft becomes more relevant."<ref name="auto1"/>

The A330 is a medium-size, wide-body airliner, with two engines suspended on pylons under the wings. On the ground, the two-wheel nose undercarriage and two four-wheel [[bogie]] main legs built by [[Messier-Dowty]] support a [[Maximum Ramp Weight]] (MRW) of {{Convert|230.9|t|lb|sigfig=3}}, while the designed [[maximum takeoff weight]] (MTOW) is {{Convert|230|t|lb|sigfig=3}} on the A330-200 variant.

The airframe of the A330 features a low-wing [[Cantilever wing|cantilever monoplane]] with a wing virtually identical to that of the A340.  The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency.<ref name=Norris_Wagner_p50-1>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pages=50–51}}</ref>{{refn|The higher the aspect ratio, the greater the aerodynamic efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/geom.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=17 March 2011|title=Wing Geometry Definitions|quote=A higher aspect ratio wing has a lower drag and a slightly higher lift than a lower aspect ratio wing.}}</ref>|group="Nb"}} The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and, along with other design features, allows a maximum operating [[Mach number]] of 0.86.<ref name="N&W p.50">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=50.}}</ref><ref name=Airbus_A330-300_specs/> The wing has a very high thickness-to-[[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] ratio of 12.8 per cent, which means that a long span and high [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] can be attained without a severe weight penalty.<ref name="Gunston p.195"/><!--{{refn|This is the thickness to chord ratio of the early Airbus A340 variants, which share the same wing with the A330.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviamarket.org/reviews/civil-aircraft/521-airbus-a340.html?start=1|publisher=Aviamarket.org|accessdate=15 May 2011|title=Airbus A340 – Design Features, Flying Controls, Landing Gear, Power Plant, Accommodation, Avionics, Dimensions|quote=...thickness/ chord ratios 15.25 per cent at root, 11.27 per cent at inner kink, 9.86 per cent at outer kink and 10.60 per cent at tip.}}</ref>|group="Nb"}}--> For comparison, the rival MD-11 has a thickness-to-chord ratio of 8–9 per cent.<ref name="Gunston p.195">{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=195.}}</ref><!--<ref>{{Cite web|title=Re-Engineering the Design Process Through Computation|date=January–February 1999|url=http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/Papers/AIAA-2412-887.pdf|format=PDF|quote=This wing is quite thick, actually thicker than the McDonnell Douglas baseline design across the span, with a thickness to chord ratio of more than 14 per cent at the root and 9 per cent at the tip.|work=[[Princeton University]]|page=11|last=Jameson|first=Anothony}}</ref></ref>--> Each wing also has a {{Convert|2.74|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} tall [[Wingtip device|winglet]] instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=31.}}</ref>

=== Undeveloped variants ===

==== A330-200Lite ====
{{See also|Airbus A350 XWB}}

To compete with Boeing's [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner#Background|7E7]], Airbus offered a minimum-change derivative called the A330-200''Lite'' in 2004. As the name indicated, this proposed variant would have had a lower maximum takeoff weight of {{Convert|202|t|lb|sigfig=3}}, coupled with de-rated engines, giving a range of {{Convert|7400|km|nmi mi|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.<ref>Ionides & Kingsley-Jones 2004, p. 10.</ref><ref name="A330-200Lite"/> It was aimed at [[Singapore Airlines]], who had looked to replace its Airbus A310-300s.<ref>{{cite web |title= Emergence of 'A330-200 Lite' Unlikely to Impact Existing Values |publisher=Aviationtoday.com |date= 28 June 2004 |url= http://www.aviationtoday.com/manufacturers/boeing/Emergence-of-A330-200-Lite-Unlikely-to-Impact-Existing-Values_3681.html |accessdate=21 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title= Singapore not ready to buy 7E7 |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date= 26 August 2004 |url= http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Singapore-not-ready-to-buy-7E7-1152549.php|accessdate=23 February 2011 |first1=James |last1=Wallace}}</ref> The variant was also to be a replacement for Airbus A300-600Rs and early Boeing 767s.<ref name="A330-200Lite">{{Cite news |work=Bloomberg News |publisher= Seattle Times |title= Airbus Looks at Offering Lite A330 To Rival B7E7 |date= 29 May 2004 |last= Rothman |first= Andrea|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20040529&slug=airbuslite29 |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> Airlines, however, were not satisfied with the compromised aircraft; the company instead proceeded with an entirely new aircraft, the A350 XWB.<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=253.}}</ref>

==== A330-300HGW ====
In 2000, it was reported that Airbus was studying an A330-300 version with a higher gross weight.  It was named A330-300HGW and had a takeoff weight of {{Convert|240|t|lb|sigfig=2}}, {{Convert|7|t|lb|sigfig=2}} greater than the −300's weight.  The version would have a strengthened wing and additional fuel capacity from a {{Convert|41600|L|USgal|adj=on|sigfig=3}} centre section fuel tank.  The A330-300HGW's range was increased to over {{Convert|11000|km|nmi mi|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}. Among those that showed interest was leasing company ILFC, which sought airliners that could fly from the US West Coast to Europe.<ref name="Longer range A330-300">''Flight International'' 2000, p. 11.</ref>

Power was to be supplied by all three engines offered to the two other A330 passenger models.  Airbus also considered using the new [[Engine Alliance GP7000]] engine for the A330-300HGW, which would have been the engine's first twinjet application. The −300HGW was to enter airline service in 2004.<ref name="Longer range A330-300"/> However, the programme was not launched and quietly disappeared.  The 240-tonne A330 would reappear years later when Airbus announced at the 2012 [[Farnborough Airshow]] that it would be an available option for both the A330-300 and the A330-200.<ref name=aspireaviation2012/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/07/09/airshow-airbus-a-idINL6E8I920R20120709 |title=Airbus to tweak A330 design – sources |date=9 July 2012 |work=Reuters |accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref> In November 2012, the maximum take off weight was further increased to 242 tonnes; the first of these aircraft was to enter service with Delta Air Lines in Q2 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/airbus-offers-new-242-tonne-a330-takeoff-weight-capability-to-extend-market-coverage/ |title=Airbus offers new 242 tonne A330 takeoff-weight capability to extend market coverage |date=29 November 2012 |work=Airbus |accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/first-242-tonne-take-off-weight-a330-starts-final-assembly/ |title=First 242 tonne take-off weight A330 starts final assembly |date=6 November 2014 |work=Airbus |accessdate=6 November 2014}}</ref> The A330neo also uses this MTOW.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Flottau|first1=Jens|title=Airbus Formally Launches A330neo With ALC As First Customer|url=http://aviationweek.com/farnborough-2014/airbus-formally-launches-a330neo-alc-first-customer|accessdate=27 June 2015|work=Aviation Week|date=14 July 2014}}</ref>

==== A330-500 ====
Also known as the A330-100, the A330-500 was a proposed "shrink" of the A330-200 version launched in July 2000 at the Farnborough Airshow,<ref name="Norris & Wagner p.103">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=103.}}</ref><ref name="-500 rejections">Kingsley-Jones & Lewis 2001, p. 6.</ref> with eight fuselage frames removed&nbsp;– four ahead and four behind the wing. This would allow for the seating of 222 passengers. The −500's maximum takeoff weight was to be {{Convert|228|t|lb|sigfig=3}}, a {{Convert|5|t|lb|adj=on|sigfig=2}} decrease from the A330-200, allowing a range of {{Convert|12970|km|nmi mi|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.

Prospective customers included ILFC, [[CIT Group|CIT Aerospace]], Lufthansa, and [[Hapag-Lloyd]]. The latter two, however, were unimpressed with the long-range variant, preferring a shorter-range aircraft, which was better suited to their route structure.<ref name="-500 rejections"/> Singapore Airlines was also an expected customer because it was looking for a replacement for the A310.<ref name="Norris & Wagner p.103"/><ref name="-500 rejections"/> Airbus intended to freeze the design in late 2001, with the first flight scheduled for the third quarter of 2003 and entry into service within a year.<ref name=Frawley_A330/> The programme was later abandoned, as interest from customers was lacking.<ref>Kingsley-Jones 2001, p. 51.</ref>
